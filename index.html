                <p>Hey There! I am a junior UX/UI Designer with a background <br>
                    in publishing and graphic design. I enjoy fast-paced worked enviroments <br>
                    with team work! I also think sometimes it's okay to enjoy some alone work time 
                    although I find team building is beneficial to certain tasks.

                        <h3> User Interface</h3>
                        <p>Here I focus on what users or real people might need to do on a particular <br>
                        site and ensure that the interface has easily assesible designs and elements to <br>
                    meet their goals! This is my favorite skill because I enjoy catchng users attention through <br> 
                different design elements!</p>

                        <p>I try to have a deep understand of what a users needs, what they value, and what <br>
                        capabilities they have when creating an application. Conducting user testing throughout <br>
                    the whole process helps both the designer and the user have a better experience!</p>

                        <p>Web development is the backbone of our websites and mobile applications. Using HTML, CSS, Javascipt, <br>
                        and many other resources to create something that is fully functional and gives me as the designer more <br>
                    flexibility to do what I want!</p>
